My name is Jasshan and welcome to my corner of the internet! This is my place to dump all the weird and interesting(debatable) things I'm working on. 

I'm an electrical engineer by training and mainly work in the hardware and embedded sphere, with a love for computers and the software that runs on it.  

You can checkout some of my projects over at my [GitHub](https://github.com/jasshanK).

Here is my system configuration for those interested:
